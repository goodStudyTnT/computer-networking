# Homework Problms and Questions

## SECTION 1.1
1.  What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?
   
    It is no difference between them. Laptops, smartphones, tablets are some types of end systems. Web server is an end system.
    
2. The word protocol is often used to describe diplomatic relations. How does Wikipedia describe diplomatic protocol?

    From Wikipedia: Diplomatic protocol is commonly described as a set of international courtesy rules. These well-established and time-honored rules have made it easier for nations and people to live and work together. Part of protocol has always been the acknowledgment of the hierarchical standing of all present. Protocol rules are based on the principles of civility.

3. Why are standards important for protocols?

    Because everyone agree on what each and every protocal does.

## SECTION 1.2
4.  List six access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide-area wireless access.<br><br>
    Home access: DSL(digital subscriber line), Cable, FTTH(fiber to the home), Dial-Up, and Satellite.<br>
    Enterprise access: LAN(local area network)[Ethernet].<br>
    Wireless access: 3G and LTE
    

5. Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?
<br><br> HFC bandwidth is shared among the users. On the downstream channel, all packets emanate from a single source, namely, the head end. Thus, there are no collisions in the downstream channel.


6. List the available residential access technologies in your city. For each type of access, provide the advertised downstream rate, upstream rate, and monthly price.
<br><br>pass
7. What is the transmission rate of Ethernet LANs? 
<br><br>With Ethernet access, users typically have 100 Mbps access to the Ethernet switch, whereas servers may have 1 Gbps or even 10 Gbps access.
8. What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?
<br><br> Copper wire.
9.  Dial-up modems, HFC, DSL and FTTH are all used for residential access For each of these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates and comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated.
<br><br> Dial-up modems: 56 kb. dedicated.
<br> HFC: downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. shared.
<br> DSL: 12 Mbps downstream and 1.8 Mbps upstream . decicated
<br> FTTH: 20Mbps decicated.
10. Describe the most popular wireless Internet access technologies today. Compare and contrast them.
<br><br>a)Wifi (802.11) In a wireless LAN, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an base station (i.e., wireless access point) within a radius of few tens of meters. The base station is typically connected to the wired Internet and thus serves to connect wireless users to the wired network.
<br>b) 3G and 4G wide-area wireless access networks. In these systems, packets are transmitted over the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony, with the  base station thus being managed by a telecommunications provider. This provides wireless access to users within a radius of tens of kilometers of the base station.
